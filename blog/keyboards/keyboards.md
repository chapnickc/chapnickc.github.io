*Reimagining the 147 year-old simulacrum*

After [147 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY), the contiguous QWERTY layout is
nothing short of archetypal in the modern typist's mind. Rife with its bias
toward ulnar adduction and inefficiency. Yet 
hundreds of millions of people type every day,
so [naturally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)
better alternatives would emerge.

Luckily, there is a cohort of inspired individuals who have 
challenged this simulacrum! Enter the world of tiny ergonomic keyboards.

This is the *Sweep*, a variant of the *Ferris* by Pierre Chevalier which became
popular in early 2021. Upon first encounter, it's easy to be overcome by a
sense of the bizarre and *outré*. When you get past that, you can unravel how
exquisite this layout is due to the decidedly minimalist design.

To achieve the functionality of a typical full-sized keyboard these 
devices rely on layers and complex behaviors.
Below I share the layers I'm experimenting with to give you an idea of how that works.

The complete transition takes time, just like playing any other
instrument. At a current typing speed over 101 WPM, and fluency with advanced
workflow tooling such as vim, tmux and i3—I absolutely demand that velocity be
matched. It will be well worth the investment and will open new neural pathways 
and efficiencies in typing.

Now, in the limit keyboards will prove to be a transient input device for
computing systems. In fact, speech-to-text already achieves higher
bandwidth and fidelity when compared to average typing speed. Nearly 3x higher
at 150 words per minute (WPM), compared to a measly 33 WPM on the keyboard.
When it comes to writing software, keyboards are still quite practical.
Especially considering the frequency of symbols or the unbounded text manipulation that takes place.
In the long run however, I have complete confidence that the traditional keyboard will
be replaced by more sophisticated input devices. Examples today would include
[surface electromyography](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3172944.3172977),
[gaze tracking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3736250), 
or other [neurolinguistic decoders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09127-3).
